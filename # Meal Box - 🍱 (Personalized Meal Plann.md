# Meal Box - 🍱 (Personalized Meal Planning & Delivery) B4A6V3

### Project Overview:

You are tasked with developing a **Meal Planning & Delivery Web Application** where users can personalize their meal plans and have meals delivered based on their dietary preferences and schedules.

### Key Features:

#### 1. User Authentication:

- Custom login system for customers and meal providers using email or phone number and password.
- Use of **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication, ensuring secure login.
- Password hashing using **bcrypt** for added security.

#### 2. Customer and Meal Provider Dashboards:

- **Customer Dashboard:** For selecting meal plans, tracking orders, and managing preferences.
- **Meal Provider Dashboard:** For managing meal menus, responding to customer orders, and tracking deliveries.

#### 3. Meal Selection & Preferences:

- Customers can select meal plans and customize meals based on dietary preferences (vegan, keto, gluten-free, etc.).
- Meal providers can create and update meal options, specifying ingredients, portion sizes, and pricing.

#### 4. Search and Match:

- Customers can search for meals based on cuisine, dietary preferences, ratings, and availability.
- Meal providers can view customer meal preferences and prepare orders accordingly.

#### 5. Role-Based Access Control:

- Different routes and views for customers and meal providers, each with access to platform-specific features.
- **Admin access** (if implemented) will be used to manage users and content.

#### 6. CRUD Operations:

- Customers can **create, view, and update** their meal plans and preferences.
- Meal providers can **view and respond** to customer meal requests.
